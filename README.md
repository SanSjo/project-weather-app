# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

We learned about API's and how to use it, basic JSON, how to use fetch() in javascript, how to use promises in JavaScript and how to work with the Date() object in JavaScript.


This is what we had to include in our project:
  - Fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript
  - All data should be present and fetched from a weather API
  - The presentation of the data should be in a specified format we got.
  - The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)
  - Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.

I was struggeling in the beginning of the project to get the days instead of hours on my forecast, but after some help from my team and from stack overflow I got it to work finally with the weekday forecast, which was my biggest struggeling this week.

And I even had spare time to do some of the stretchgoals such as changing background colors depending on weather, and I also did gradients backgrounds so it looks like clouds, when cloudy. I also got the weather icons to show from the json, which I was proud of.

If I would have more time I would have changed background to nighttime mode.

This is my project with all requirements. https://weather-app-sthlm.netlify.com/
