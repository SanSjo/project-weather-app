# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

In this project we learned about API's and how to use it, basic JSON, how to use fetch() in javascript, how to use promises in JavaScript and how to work with the Date() object in JavaScript.

I was struggeling in the beginning of the project to get the days instead of hours on my forecast, but after some help from my team and from stack overflow I got it to work finally with the weekday forecast, which was my biggest struggeling this week.

And I even had spare time to do some of the stretchgoals such as changing background colors depending on weather, and I also did gradients backgrounds so it looks like clouds, when cloudy. I also got the weather icons to show from the json, which I was proud of.

If I would have more time I would have changed background to nighttime mode.

This is my project with all requirements. https://weather-app-sthlm.netlify.com/
