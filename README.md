# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

This week's project is to build a simple weather web app that tells today's weather and temperature, and a weekly forecast using a weather API.

In this project we learned about API's and how to use it, basic JSON, how to use fetch() in javascript, how to use promises in JavaScript and how to work with the Date() object in JavaScript.

A lot of useful learning :)
